#### Calculated fee:

A calculated fee for a payment is a fee that is calculated based on the amount of the payment.

For example, a payment service might charge a fee of 3% + $0.30 for each payment made. 

```js

* @notice: this function only runs before the submit function and to calcalte the fees. It runs by the borrower.

* @param lendingAmount uint256 is total lending amount without the interest

#### calculate interest fee


Interest is a fee that is charged by a lender to a borrower for the use of money. It is usually expressed as a percentage of the principal amount borrowed and is typically paid periodically, such as monthly or annually. Interest is typically charged on loans, such as mortgages, car loans, and credit card balances, and is used by lenders to compensate them for the risk and cost of lending money. The rate of interest can vary widely depending on a variety of factors, including the creditworthiness of the borrower, the terms of the loan, and market conditions.



The formula for calculating the interest on a loan is:

![formula](./BP.png)


Where:

* n is the number of period time, Time is the length of time over which the interest is being calculated, usually expressed in years.
* m is a factory of the time; for example 1 year is 12 months, monthly is 1 month.
* bp is the buy power


For example, if you borrow $10,000 at an interest rate of 5% per year for a period of 3 years, the interest would be calculated as follows:


It's important to note that this is just a basic formula for calculating simple interest. There are many other factors that can affect the interest calculation, such as compounding frequency, fees, and different types of loan structures, such as adjustable-rate mortgages.


```js
  useEffect(() => {
    if ((bp, apy, numPay)) {
      var arr = [];
      let sum = 0;
      let incrementDate =
        loanType === 12 ? "months" : loanType === 4 ? "quarters" : "months";
      for (let i = 0; i < numPay; i++) {
        let interest =
          ((Math.pow(1 + parseFloat(apy) / 100, numPay / loanType) - 1) /
            parseFloat(numPay)) *
          parseFloat(bp);
        let total = interest * parseInt(numPay);
        console.log(total.toFixed(18));
        setTotalInterest(parseFloat(total)?.toFixed(18));
        // * parseFloat(bp)
        if (i === numPay - 1) {
          arr.push([
            moment(startDate.getTime())
              .add(loanType === 2 ? (i + 1) * 6 : i + 1, incrementDate)
              .unix(),
            interest,
            parseFloat(bp),
            interest + parseFloat(bp),
          ]);
        } else {
          arr.push([
            moment(startDate.getTime())
              .add(loanType === 2 ? (i + 1) * 6 : i + 1, incrementDate)
              .unix(),
            interest,
            0,
            interest,
          ]);
