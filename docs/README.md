Welcome to the SwopX APIs documentation.

SwopX is the leading blockchain with Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, search, API, and analytics platform for NFTs on Ethereum. We use AI and Machine Learning for millions of NFTs to give price forecasts for any NFT, even with no prior price or sales history.
 
To provide equitable access to AI data, we've developed the SwopX Developer APIs to empower developers and enterprises with direct access to data and services via GET/POST requests.
